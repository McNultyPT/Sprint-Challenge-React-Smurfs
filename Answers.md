1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Client-side routing can be less efficient in most cases because everytime a post is made the whole page reloads, but it can be more beneficial if you want your website to come up quicker on a search engine, because search engines are optimized for client-side routing. Server-side routing sends an AJAX request to the server and instead of reloading the whole page, the server only sends back the piece of data requested.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

    Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

    Create, Read, Update and Delete.

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

    'Post' is a create method, 'Put' is an update method and 'Delete' is a delete method.

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.

    You can use 'fetch' to request the data then '.then' and '.catch' to handle the data being returned.
